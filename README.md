# React Redux Shopping Cart Application

This project is a shopping cart application built using React and Redux Toolkit. The application fetches product data from a JSON file and allows users to view products, add them to the cart, and manage the cart (update quantities, remove items, and apply discounts). The total quantity and total amount are automatically updated based on the cart's content. The project includes a simple navigation system and is deployed for online access.
